# Library Management System — Staff UI

This is a front‑end demo for library staff. It runs entirely in the browser (no server), using small JSON seed files and the browser’s localStorage to simulate state.

## How Data Flows
- Seed data
  - `data/books.json` provides the catalog, liked/featured lists, and sample shipments.
  - `data/shelving.json` provides a queue of copies to be shelved.
- Local changes (persisted per browser)
  - `localStorage.catalogUpdates`: per‑book updates (count, shelf location) made from Inventory.
  - `localStorage.shelvingQueue`: current shelving queue state (Pending/Shelved/Inspection).
  - `localStorage.shelvingLog`: activity history from the Shelving Assistant.
  - `localStorage.transferShipments`: current shipment list after staff actions.
  - `localStorage.shipmentReports`: reports generated by Transfer for Inventory to review.
  - `localStorage.transferLog`: audit log of actions taken in Transfer.
- Book covers
  - Pages start with a local placeholder `assets/images/book_fb.png`.
  - If an ISBN is available, they try OpenLibrary covers; if loading fails, they stick with the placeholder.

Tip: to “reset” the demo, clear localStorage in your browser dev tools and refresh.

## Pages & What They Do

### Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)
- Central landing page for staff with quick links in the left sidebar:
  - Inventory Management → `inventory.html`
  - Shelving Assistant → `shelving_assistant.html`
  - Transfer & Logistics → `transfer_logistics.html`
- Shows featured, new arrivals, and most‑liked carousels (images use the placeholder first, then try to fetch real covers).
- Includes a simple recent activity section (static sample text).

### Inventory Management (`inventory.html`, `js/inventory.js`)
- Browse and search catalog across title, author, and genre.
- Inline actions per book:
  - `+ / −` to adjust copy counts.
  - Edit icon to set or change the shelf location.
- Details modal shows book info and cover (with placeholder fallback).
- Persistence
  - On load, merges seed data from `data/books.json` with any local edits in `localStorage.catalogUpdates`.
  - Changes are saved immediately to `catalogUpdates` so they persist across page reloads.
- Incoming Shipment Reports section
  - Displays reports created in Transfer (from `localStorage.shipmentReports`).
  - Inventory Manager can mark a report as “Resolved” to remove it from the queue.
  - Note: Resolving a report does not change inventory counts automatically; counts are adjusted manually using the table actions.

### Shelving Assistant (`shelving_assistant.html`, `js/shelving.js`)
- Shows a queue of book copies that need shelving.
- For each copy, staff select a condition and click “Mark as Shelved”.
  - If condition is “Damaged”, the copy is routed to “Inspection”.
- Cover handling
  - Starts with the local placeholder image.
  - If an ISBN exists, tries to load an OpenLibrary cover; if it fails, it falls back to the placeholder.
- Persistence
  - Loads from `localStorage.shelvingQueue` if present; otherwise seeds from `data/shelving.json` and saves it.
  - Every action updates `shelvingQueue` and appends a record into `localStorage.shelvingLog` (visible under Recent Shelving Activity).
- Plays a short success sound on completion.

### Transfer & Logistics (`transfer_logistics.html`, `js/transfer.js`)
- Manages incoming shipments and creates a lightweight paper trail for Inventory.
- Incoming shipments
  - Seeded from `data/books.json` (or example data if none present), then merged with `localStorage.transferShipments`.
  - Actions per shipment: Accept, Delay, Reject.
- When a shipment is Accepted
  - A report is created and added to `localStorage.shipmentReports`.
  - The Transfer log is updated in `localStorage.transferLog`.
- Inventory then sees these reports on the Inventory page, resolves them after manual updates, and the report disappears from the pending list.

## Common UI Patterns
- Fallback images: all book images default to `assets/images/book_fb.png` and only switch if a valid cover is confirmed.
- Feedback: buttons give quick visual feedback; some actions play a subtle success sound.
- Animations: lightweight “fade‑in” styles are used for page sections.

## Getting Started
- Open `dashboard.html` in a browser.
- Use the sidebar links to navigate to Inventory, Shelving Assistant, and Transfer & Logistics.
- To simulate a full workflow:
  1) Go to Transfer & Logistics and Accept a shipment (creates a report).
  2) Go to Inventory, review the report, adjust counts manually as needed, and Mark as Resolved.
  3) Use Shelving Assistant to process copies; watch activity build in the log.

## Resetting the Demo
- Clear `localStorage` in your browser and refresh pages to return to the seeded state from `data/*.json`.

## NOTE
- Note everything is in working condition right now, as of the next deadline, we need to show the page interfaces. So, that is the main focus at the moment.
